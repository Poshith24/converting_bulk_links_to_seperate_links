# converting_bulk_links_to_seperate_links

I actually copy various types of web links in my day-to-day life like articles and blogs links so all will be stored in my clipboard at the end of the i paste somewhere 
in my whatsapp or discord but pasting every url seperately it takes some time i thought automate the process of seperating so I wrote a code. I was just trying a daily 
facing problem using coding.

I'll really appreciate if anyone comes with more optimal solution because i know about the code. It's just a brute force approach. It can be even better. I'm here to collabarate with you all:)
